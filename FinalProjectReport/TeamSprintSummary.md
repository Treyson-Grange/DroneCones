# Flapjack Heros Sprint Summary #
## Sprint 6: Testing and Deployment
For this sprint, everybody searched for bugs in the website to fix. We also worked on writing the users manual. We had two virtual meetings to make sure everyone knew what to do.

For this sprint, people worked on the following:
* Emily McBride: wrote installation instructions and ordering section of users manual. Fixed bugs on ordering page.
* Matt Rau: Wrote unit tests for the database. Wrote the manager section of the users manual. Fixed bug in restocking database functions.
* Jordan Olsen: Wrote software overview and drone owner section of the users manual. Also did some UI revisions to improve the user experience. Fixed bug in editing drones
* Samuel McMillan: Wrote the troubleshooting section of the users manual. Got recent order history up. Helped create manager section and ordering sections of users manual.
* Treyson Grange: Wrote getting started section of users manual. Added timer for orders to simulate delivery time.
* Nathan Taylor - Wrote FAQs section of the users manual. Assembled individual parts of manual into one file. 


Successes:
* Communication for this sprint was good. Everybody knew their part and everybody got it done. There wasn't too many people working on any one thing.


## Sprint 5: Development Pt3
For these two weeks we continued work on functionality of our app. We met online that Monday night (i.e., the first night of the sprint) to make sure each person knew what needed to be done and gave out tasks to do. We also met for work days. 

For this sprint of development we worked on the following
* Treyson: Finished Drone Account Information and worked on the capabilities of the order timer
* Emily: Finished the ordering page
* Matt: Primarily worked on the manager stock ordering page and the support form pages. Also, helped with database and some other small things in the program
* Jordan: Got the drone owner page working.
* Nathan: Got done with the support form page
* Samuel: Created revenue graphs for the manager and worked on showing the customer when drones weren't available for use

Setbacks: 
* Figuring out the database with ordering stuff is a bit tricky for the shopping cart page 

Succusses:
* I want to go into a bit more detail of how good we did. This was in my opinion our best sprint! Everyone was doing their part. Each person was making progress on their part. I took the time to go through the entire project and make a list of all the things I thought needed to be done or might be good to get done (i.e., definately helpful for people to know what we had left to do). Each of us when we finished our part helped conquer that list of tasks!
* We worked so hard that it felt right to throw a pancake party on the last work day. I brough some pancakes and they brought some toppings. It was fun!
* I think this was the busiest sprint for us but we really worked hard as a team trying to help out one another as we had extra time apart from our individual parts!

## Sprint 4: Development Pt2
For these two weeks we continued work on functionality of our app. We met online a few times for progress reports and to split up tasks. We also met for work days. 

For this sprint of development we worked on the following
* Treyson: Finished Login functionality
* Emily and Samuel: Continued work on ordering functionality (Not done)
* Matt: Finished database and started manager page. (Not done) 
* Jordan: Started drone owener page and styling work. (Not done)
* Nathan: Started Payment page (Not done)

Setbacks: 
* There were 3 people working on the login functionality, but nothing was getting done, so I set the two others to another task and tackled it myself. 
* Everyone was really busy so nothing got done.

## Sprint 3: Development

### Sprint 1 of Development Phase ###
For the first two weeks spent on Development, we had an initial meeting to discuss what framework we wanted to use (we decided on using Vue, Nuxt, Supabase, and Typescipt) on October 4th, during that meeting we also had an introduction to the framework we'd be using to get everyone on the same page, and another meeting on October 7th to split up work.

For this Development sprint, each of the team members worked on the following:
* Emily and Samuel worked on developing the ordering page and functionality
* Matt worked on setting up the database and creating functions for using accessing, adding, and manipulating data in the database
* Jordan, Treyson, and Nathan worked on the Login page and adding users to the database.

During this sprint we also met up on each of the work days during class for the week of October 9th through 13th to work on the project together as a group.


## Sprint 2: Design ##

### High-Level Design ###
For our week spent on the High-Level design, we had an initial meeting on September 19 to discuss what would be needed, and split up work amongst our group. We then had a follow-up meeting on the 22nd to present our work, and discuss any changes or further work that was necessary.

For the High-Level Design, each of the team members worked on the following:
*   Jordan worked on the Security design, and the user interface design.
*   Treyson also worked primarily on the user interface design.
*   Emily wrote our expectations for the hardware platform of our application, and working the internal interfaces.
*   Nathan also worked on the internal interfaces.
*   Samuel and Matt worked on the external interfaces together.

### Low-Level Design ###
For this week, we had one online meeting on September 26 where we discussed how to break up the work. We then had a follow-up in person meeting on September 29 where each group presented their work so far for feedback from the rest of the group, before working together for a while on defining the low level design.

For the Low-Level Design, each of the team members worked on the following:
*   Samuel and Jordan made a text-based ui flow of the entire web app, and created a basic ui/ux prototype for some use cases using Figma.
*   Emily, Treyson and Nathan worked together to define the back-end design, including defining the various classes and class relationships used by our web app. They also created uml diagrams to represent these classes.
*   Matt worked to define our apps database structure, defining what tables and columns are needed, as well as defining a list of functions that will interact with the database to preserve abstraction.



## Sprint 1: Requirements ##
We started with an introductory meeting September 12 in which we started to talk about requirements, and split work on the requirements document

*   Treyson worked on the use cases diagram and set up the GitLab
*   Samuel worked on the user requirements
*   Emily worked on the business requirements
*   Matt worked on the github, helped on the use cases diagram and GitLab formatting
*   Nathan worked on the customer requirements
*   Jordan worked on functional requirements and led the team.
We believe we have a strong grasp on the requirements as we go into the design phase of this project.
