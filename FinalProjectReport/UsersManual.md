Once you have selected all of your flavors, we now get to pick our cones. We have three options at Drone Cones, Waffle cone, Sprinkle cone, and Chocolate cone. Simply click "Add to Order" to make your selection. You will see your currently selected option at the top.

# The Order Page

## Creating an Order
* Once logged in, if you are a regular user and not a drone owner or manager, you will be directed to the Ordering page.
* The Ordering page can also be accessed through the navigation bar at the top of the page.
![Navigation Bar](OrderImages/navbar.png) 
* From the ordering page, we can then fill out an order by choosing ice cream flavors, cone, and toppings.
* If a button for a flavor/topping/cone is pink, this would indicate that either an item is out of stock or (in the case of scoops) you have yet to choose a first or second flavor of ice cream. In order to choose a second or third ice cream scoop, you must choose a first and second scoop.
![Pink Buttons](OrderImages/pinkButtons.png) 
* There is also an option if you accidentally chose a second or third flavor and decide you do not want a second or third flavor to remove those scoops from your order. If you press the second flavor's "No Second Scoop" button, this will result in clearing the Second and Third flavor from your order
![Selected](OrderImages/selected.png) 
![No Second Scoop](OrderImages/noScoop.png) 
* The user can pick 1 to 3 scoops for their ice cream cone in any flavors that are available (indicated by blue buttons).
![Add To Order](OrderImages/addtoOrder.png) 
* Once ice cream scoops have been selected, you are able to add a cone and topping. The cone and the First flavor of ice cream are the only requirements for creating an order, while the Second and Third flavor as well as the topping are optional.
* The cone and topping can be selected in the same way as the First scoop of ice cream, by selecting the "Add to Order" button below the name of the cone or topping.
![Cone Select](OrderImages/cone.png) 
![Topping Select](OrderImages/topping.png) 
* If a first scoop of ice cream or a cone has not been selected, the "Add to Cart" button will remain pink (unable to add order to cart) until both are selected. Once they have been selected, the button will turn blue and you may add your order to the cart.
![Unable to Add to Cart](OrderImages/addToCart.png)

# Troubleshooting

## Login Page
## When I register my account, I am not getting a confirmation email about it?
Wait a few minutes…It’s been known to take up to 20 minutes for the email to send.


## Order page
## When I try to add a flavor, cone type, or topping it doesn’t add?
Check the color of the “add to order” button. It will appear pink if the item requested is out of stock.
## I want order multiple cones in one transaction with different attributes, but the cone specifications stay the same when I add the first one to the cart?
Click “Create New Order” button to refresh the specifications. The previous cone added to the cart will remain in the cart until deleted from the cart page itself.

## Drones page
## I want to remove my drone from your system but there is no delete button?
Click the Edit button for the drone to be removed. Change the status to delete and click save to delete.
## Why doesn’t it work when I change the drone information?
Try waiting a couple more seconds before saving the new updated drone information. Editing drones in a few seconds can sometimes not allow for the computer to know what is happening.
