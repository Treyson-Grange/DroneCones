# Drone Cones Low Level Design

## UI Design

* A new user creating an account. 
   * Go to the landing page
   * Sign up on page
   * Inputs needed to sign up with:
      * Toggle button to decide whether the account is for a customer or drone owner
      * Username
      * Email Address 
      * Password
      * Submit button
* A customer Placing an order 
   * Go to the landing page
      * Enter in Username and password in text fields to login
      * Sign-in button
   * Have a menu bar that has the following pages to toggle between:
      * Account information
      * Make an order (i.e., the default home page for)
      * Support page
      * Shopping Cart (i.e., the page to show items one is wanting to order)
   * Go to the make an order page
      * Make an order page
         * A list of past orders with a onclick ability to make it their order if they desire
         * On the page there will be three ice cream flavor options put as buttons to click to choose an order
         * On the page there will be number of scoop options put as buttons to click to choose an order
         * A list of toppings with an onclick capability to put with order
         * Add to cart button to save order of one ice-cream cone which will submit the order to the shopping cart page and refresh the page
         * Create new order button that refreshes the options on the page if you want to create another order
   * Shopping Cart page
      * Displays the list of cones about to be ordered by you
      * There will also be a remove item from cart button next to each cone order
      * There will be a text box for the address to deliver it to
      * Next to the text box for the address have a button that when clicked saves address for future orders to the costumers account. There will be a default address preprogrammed in if the user has already saved there address to the account that can be overwritten by just simply backspacing and writing a new address.
      * A few text boxes for payment information
         * Name on card
         * Date of expiration on Card
         * Card Number
         * Security Code
      * Next to payment information there will be a button that when clicked saves information for future orders to the costumers account. There will be a default payment information preprogrammed in if the user has already saved there payment information to the account that can be overwritten by just simply backspacing and writing new payment information for each of the text boxes. (Maybe implement on 2.0 but a little unnecessary to save information for default input later)
      * Display prices
         * How much for each item in order
         * Tax
         * How much for the total order
      * A place order button that places the order
      * A list of most recent order status
         * Placed
         * Ready
         * In transit (have a default timer to determine how long it is in transit for this phase)
         * Delivered
   * Account Information Page
      * We see this as redundant so we might delete this page for the customer since the address and payment information can be changed and viewed in the shopping cart page?? Do we need to save credit card info and addresses? Ask Erik? (maybe weâ€™ll just implement it for fun)
   * Support page
      * A text field to write out what you want support with
      * Submit help button which when clicked with say form submitted on a new page it will take you to (i.e., the admin will respond to questions to the email they put when signing up)
* Drone owner:
   * Go to the landing page and input Username and Password into the text fields to access account
      * Click the login button on the landing page which will take them to the main page of the software
   * The main page that has a menu bar with the following links:
      * Account information 
      * Drone information (i.e., default main page for drone owners)
      * Support page (if the app is not working how they want)
   * Drone information Page
      * Add new drone button
         * Once button a form a will open for new drone information. This form contains:
            * Name: identifier for the drone owner in a text field
            * Size: (small - 1 cone, medium - 4 cones, big - 8 cones) with a drop down menu of the three sizes of drones
            * Upload drone button
      * List of all the drones
         * Each drone will be have a menu with a enable or disable or delete option to choose from (i.e., there will be a default of enabled for all new drones added to the page)
         * Save button to save changes of enable or disable or delete option for all drones modified 
   * Account information page
      * Total revenue in app
      * Transfer to bank button which has defaults to the last bank information specified. If there has never been a bank specified or the user wants to add a bank to transfer to there will be a bank information form 
         * Bank information form:
            * Routing number text field
            * Account number text field
            * Submit button to save changed

## Intermediary functions
Here are the function signatures for various functions that will interact with the database system, in order to abstract our use of Supabase as well as standardize our database queries.

### Users
There is no addUser function. A row is added to the user table simulaneous to the use of Supabase's auth signup function through sql function.

getUser(userID: string)
*   returns the row with given userID as a user object

updateUser(userID: string, userUpdate: User object)
*   updates the row of user database with given UserID, changing the columns that are specified in userUpdate

toggleUserBan(userID: string)
*   toggles the banned column of the user with userID

getUsers(userType: number = None)
*   returns a list of all user in database as user objects. If a UserType is specified, it only returns those types of users

addAddress(userID: number, Country: Str, City: Str, State: Str, ZipCode: Str, StreetAddress: Str, Apartment: Str = None)
*   Adds a row into address database with given information

getUsersAddress(userID: number)
*   returns the row from address database associated with the given userID, currently only returns the first address

### Transactions
addTransaction(transaction: Transaction object, droneIDS: number[])
*   Adds a new row to transaction database with the data in transaciton object,
*   Adds new rows to drone deliveries database for each droneID in droneIDs
*   Adds new rows to soldItems database, for each item in the items list

getTransactions()
*   returns all transactions in database

getUserOrderHistory(UserID: string, limit: number = 3)
*   returns all transactions tied to given UserID, including all items in the order. 
*   If limit is specified, it returns that many, otherwise returns three most recent

getTransaction(transactionID)
*   returns transaction with given transactionID as a transaction object

addItemInProgress(item: ItemInProgress object)

getUsersItemsInProgress(userId: string)
*   returns a list of all itemsInProgress with the given userID

removeUsersItemsInProgress(userID: string)
*   deletes all itemInProgress rows with the given userID from the database

addAllSoldItems(userId: string, transactionID: number)
*   Retrieves all itemsInProgress for the given userID

*   calls removeUsersItemsInProgress to delete those items

addSoldItem(TransactionID: Int, item: OrderItem object)
*   adds a new row in Sold Items database with given information

updateStock(item: OrderItem)
*   Goes through each part of the OrderItem and reduces the amount of each by 1

addDroneDelivery(TransactionID: Int, DroneID: Int)
